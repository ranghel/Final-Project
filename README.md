# Final Project

**Fertility Drugs Donation Program** is designed to help those who have to pay out of pocket for Infertility treatments and medication. It connects those of you who have left overs (unopened and unused meds to donate), with those in need of medication. Every little bit counts, and every donation is greatly appreciated! Some examples of desired fertility drugs include: 
* Follistim/Gonal-F 
* Repronex/Menopur 
* Ganirelix/Cetrotide 
* Prometrium/Progesterone 
* Ovidrel/HCG Triggers 
* Bravelle
* Clomid 
* Crione 
* Vivelle 
* Luveris 
* Lupron 
* Dexamethasone 

If you have drugs to donate, please create a post with the following information:
1. Type of drugs and quantity available (units, vials, etc.) 
1. Expiration date of drugs *very important* 
1. The soonest date you are able to donate your meds 

If you need donations, create a post of what you need, the dosage, and upload a copy of your Prescription. 

All the donations are truly appreciated; every little bit makes a HUGE difference to those that are paying out of pocket!
