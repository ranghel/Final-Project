# Helping Hands 
![Logo](public/css/imgs/logo.png)

As a recent IVF patient, I have found myself with a great quantity of unused fertility medication, which would be such a shame to go to waste since these drugs are so expensive. I've done some research to find an application that connects those with medication left overs with those in need of medication, but except forums and people exchanging emails over these forums, I didn't find such an app. Therefore, I strongly believe that this application will come in handy for the thousands of women undergoing IVF treatments.

**Helping Hands** is a **Fertility Medication Donation Program** designed to help those who have to pay out of pocket for Infertility treatments and medication. It connects those of you who have left overs (unopened and unused meds to donate), with those in need of medication. Every little bit counts, and every donation is greatly appreciated! Some examples of desired fertility drugs include: 
* Follistim/Gonal-F 
* Repronex/Menopur 
* Ganirelix/Cetrotide 
* Prometrium/Progesterone 
* Ovidrel/HCG Triggers 
* Bravelle
* Clomid 
* Crione 
* Vivelle 
* Luveris 
* Lupron 
* Dexamethasone 

If you have drugs to donate, please create a post with the following information:
1. Type of medication and quantity available (units, vials, etc.) 
1. Expiration date of the medication *very important* 
1. The soonest date you are able to donate your meds 

If you need donations, create a post of what you need, the dosage, and upload a copy of your Prescription. 

All the donations are truly appreciated; every little bit makes a HUGE difference to those that are paying out of pocket!
